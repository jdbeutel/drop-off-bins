drop-off-bins
=============

Honolulu's [big, white, multi-material drop-off bins](http://www.opala.org/solid_waste/multi_material_recycling_center_locations.html)
are often full when I go try to drop off my recycling.
This web app will help recyclers find ones that are not full,
and help the management company schedule efficient pick-ups,
with a map for sharing status reports.
