drop-off-bins
=============

The [big, white, multi-material drop-off bins](http://www.opala.org/solid_waste/multi_material_recycling_center_locations.html)
are often full when you go try to drop off your recycling.
This web app will help users find ones that are not full,
and help the management company schedule efficient pick-ups,
with a map for sharing status reports.
